GOLAP vs GOLTP
<br/>
We complement graph online transaction processing systems (graph OLTP systems) such as Amazon Neptune, JanusGraph and OpenLink Virtuoso, out of the box and have capability to support other graph OLTP systems like Neo4j. While these graph OLTP systems, among other value propositions, are good for identifying individual entities and relationships, graph OLAP systems such as AnzoGraph are good at executing analytics and aggregation queries across various entities and relationships. Think MySQL vs Netezza or Amazon Aurora vs Amazon Redshift but for graph. As a result where Neo4j did the LUBM benchmark with scale factor=100 and 250, AnzoGraph did LUBM with scale factor of 4,400,000 and provided analytics at much faster speeds.
